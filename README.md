## Hello everyone.
This repository is part of my plan, so Iâ€™m waiting for everyone on my server and tg!

   
    To get into it, let me tell you a little about the project!
    This project is being created on the basis of the Linux Manjaro
    operating system, below I will give a command that you can copy and paste, as they say!
    So let's say for the laziest, we have Ctrl+V buttons. Of course, I do not approve of this 
    method, so I ask you to write everything with pens!
By the way, we configure this assembly in the terminal.

## Now the instructions
 ![manjaro](http://simosnet.com/livecdroom/source/manjaro/manjaro/extra/plymouth-theme-manjaro/manjaro-logo.png)

## First you need to write the command:
      $ sudo su
After you have entered the command, press the Enter button.
After pressing the button, enter the following command.
## Next command
      $ curl -LO
